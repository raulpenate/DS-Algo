Data patterns refer to the regularities or trends that exist within a dataset. In the context of data structures, these patterns can be used to inform the design and implementation of the data structure in order to optimize it for the specific types of data it will be storing and the operations that will be performed on that data.

!!! Tip
    When you are working in problems remember these principles to understand the problem:

    1. **Understand the problems**
        - Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.
    2. **Explore concrete examples**
        - Start with simple examples and progress to more complex.
        - Explore examples with empty and invalid inputs.
    3. **Break it down**
        - Explicity write out the steps you need to take.
    4. **Solve/Simplify**
        - Do I've enough info to solve the problem?
    5. **How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?**
        - Can you check the result?
        - Can you improve the performance?
