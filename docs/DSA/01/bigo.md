Big O notation is a mathematical notation that is used to describe the performace or complexity of an algorith. It's a way of expressing how the number of operations that an algorithm performs scales as the input size grows.

Another thing to add is that there are multiple ways to describe asymptotic notation like Big Omega and Big Theta, but I'm going to use the Big O that is used in the industry, just Big O, which offers the tightest description of a runtime.
